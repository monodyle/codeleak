Share link, with a code!

## What is this?

This is a service that save your link as a code and share with others, then
they can paste it back to decode. Everything in a few clicks.

Example: I can encode `http://github.com/monodyle/share-code` to a random
string like `W4G890Q2`. If someone using `W4G890Q2` to reveal, they will get
`http://github.com/monodyle/share-code`.

## Features

- Encode a link as code
- Reveal code for the link
- Save all encoded links on account
